This is a just for fun mobile web site that I wrote to work with a scavenger hunt I had planned in the San Juan Islands. Cell service is spotty on the island so I needed to write something that could be loaded once and then work for a long period of time with just GPS. The site is obviously mobile optimized and should work with at least iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.

The locations and clues are hardcoded into the site, and the user is guided from clue to clue using their current location as determinded by their phone using the html5 geolocation feature.  They site tells the user how far they are (in km or meters) from their next clue and which cardinal direction they need to head.

I had a lot of fun creating this and I know people have enjoyed using it as well.
